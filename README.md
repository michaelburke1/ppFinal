Asteroids! For our Twisted PyGame final project we made a multiplayer asteroid shooter game.
As a player, you control a ship and dodge asteroids and enemy fire. If hit by either, you die
but can respond. 

Move around the map using the normal key pad and aim and shoot with the mouse. Click to shoot.

Your lasers take out asteroids and enemy ships. One hit from either and you die.
If your ship is not alive, just click the mouse once again to respawn. 

Start the game by running:
	python2.7 uServer.py

Once running, a user can run:
	python2.7 uClient.py 

to join the action. 

Hit Control-C to exit the game from the uClient.py window.
